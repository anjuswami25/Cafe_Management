Restaurant Order System
This project is a Python Console Application that simulates a simple restaurant ordering system, allowing users to place orders for menu items and calculate the total bill.

Introduction
I created this project to practice Python programming and enhance my understanding of user input handling, conditional statements, and dictionary operations. The application is designed to provide a user-friendly way to select menu items and calculate the total cost of the order.

The project was built as a small but practical program, useful for beginners looking to learn the basics of Python. The system includes a predefined menu, handles user input for ordering, and validates the availability of menu items.

Functionalities
1. Displaying the Menu
The program displays a predefined menu with the available items and their respective prices:
Pizza: Rs90
Pasta: Rs50
Burger: Rs70
Salad: Rs90
Coffee: Rs80
2. Placing an Order
The user is prompted to enter the name of an item they want to order.
The system checks if the item is available in the menu:
If the item is available, it adds the item's price to the order total and confirms the addition.
If the item is not available, it notifies the user.
3. Adding Additional Items
After the first item, the user is asked if they want to add another item to their order:
If the user responds "Yes," they can enter the name of a second item.
The system validates and processes the second item similarly to the first.
4. Calculating the Total Bill
After the user completes their order, the program calculates and displays the total cost of the items ordered.
